    "# Analysing San Francisco Crime dataset\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "The crime rate in San-Francisco became the topic of relevancy over the years of progressive violence in the city sidewalks. As an example, 2018 statistic shows the average violent crime rate, which exceeded 150% over other United States cities, inferring to the potential threat that people faces while kindly stepping the sidewalk. As if some areas might be safe, some areas extremely violent with a high chance of being robbed, such as Tenderloin. Also, most of the crimes are related to thefts and property crimes. The following analysis provides which part of the cities are the most dangerous ones and also will give a description of the current problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2018 city faced 65 calls per day with the compliancy of theft, and becoming the second most frequent city with compliancy issues among other United State cities. Frequency of the compliancy gave birth to a \"poop patrol\" to deal with amid homelessness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the high compliancy on crime-level in San-Francisco, research on this dataset would provide intriguing insights and information about the city crime frequency and possible analysis combatting the issue of high violence. Moreover, timestamps would be an additional source for analysis to explain the appearance and location of each crime. Reshaped and sanitized results would deliver infographics for different variables, thus: time, location, and form of the crime.\n",
